/*
In this task, you will need to use multiple variables and combine them together into the time of the day.
  For example it will be something like this:
    12:24:33 PM
In the beginning of the code, declare three int variables: hour, minute, second and declare a String variable: amOrPm.
You only need to declare, no assignment.

In the middle of the code, the variables will be assigned a value using Scanner.
Do not touch anything in this section.

In the end of the code, use the variables to put together and print the time of the day using the following format:
hours:minutes:seconds amOrPm
Main topics: variables, primitive datatypes, String, Scanner, concatenation
